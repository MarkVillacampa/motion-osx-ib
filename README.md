This is an example on how to use the [ib gem](https://github.com/yury/ib) in a OSX RubyMotion 2.0 application.

If you make any changes to the outlets in your ruby code, you have to call `rake ib:open` to regenerate the stubs, and open XCode.

## Requirements:

- Rubymotion 2.0
- ib gem installed (`gem install ib`)
